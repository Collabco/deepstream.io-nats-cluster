# deepstream.io-nats-cluster

Community maintained clustering for deepstream.io (https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io) using NATS (https://nats.io).

This has been inspired and heavily derived from the work on the deepstream.io-cluster project (https://github.com/wehriam/deepstream.io-cluster)

This is a work in progress, the unit tests work but it hasn't yet been tested in production.
